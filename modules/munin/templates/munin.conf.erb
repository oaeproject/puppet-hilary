# Graphics files are normaly generated by munin-graph, no matter if

# munin-cgi-graph is invoked by the web server up to very many times at the
# same time.  This is not optimal since it results in high CPU and memory
# consumption to the degree that the system can thrash.  Again the default is
# 6.  Most likely the optimal number for max_cgi_graph_jobs is the same as
# max_graph_jobs.

# If the automatic CGI url is wrong for your system override it here:
#
#cgiurl_graph /cgi-bin/munin-cgi-graph

# munin-graph runs in parallel, the number of concurrent processes is
# 6.  If you want munin-graph to not be parallel set to 0.  If set too
# high it will slow down munin-graph.  Some experiments are needed to
# determine how many are optimal on your system.  On a multi-core
# system with good SCSI disks the number can probably be quite high.
