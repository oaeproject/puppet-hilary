# Useful for tailing the app server logs, filtering out the syslog pre-amble and feeding it through bunyan.
# Example usage:
#
# tail -f <path to log> | filter-bunyan
#
# or:
#
# head -100 <path to log> | filter-bunyan

# * stdbuf 			- I think it defers flushing the buffer to stdout until a full line has been read. This seems to be necessary
# for both the tr and cut for tail -f to actually be formatted properly by bunyan.
#
# * tr -s ' ' 		- This "squeezes" spaces, as multiple spaces will trip up the parsing by "cut"
#
# * cut -d' ' -f 6- - This takes columns 6 and on from a space-separated line. Basically slices out the syslog preamble

stdbuf -oL tr -s ' ' | stdbuf -oL cut -d' ' -f 6- | bunyan
