# Useful for tailing the app server logs, filtering out the syslog pre-amble and feeding it through bunyan.
# Example usage:
#
# tail -f <path to log> | filter-bunyan
#
# or:
#
# head -100 <path to log> | filter-bunyan

# stdbuf I think flushes the buffer after each line, so bunyan gets all the data as it is tailed out.
# It's absolutely necessary for "tail -f"

stdbuf -oL cut -d' ' -f 6- | bunyan
